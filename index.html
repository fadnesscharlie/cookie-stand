              We are a family run business that strives to bring a new creation to the world through Salmon and cookies. We were inspired after eating grilled salmon and going for desert of cookies. The flavors blended so well, that we had to recreate and show it off to the whole world!

              Our first cookie layout came from an idea our children made, and that inspired us on our cookie design. Above you can see our first example with very first cookie cutter! Our daughter has been so excited to be able to have something that she made on this site for you all to see and know she was able to express her idea, and have that idea come to life in a way that helps her family and bring Salmon Cookies to everyone around her.
